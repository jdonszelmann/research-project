# TAPF

(almost) MAPFM.
Differences (according to this paper)
* Each color/team is given the same number of targets
* *Makespan* is minimized, not *sum of all costs*

Anonymous MAPF: only one team exists

"state of the art algorithm": [Ma and Koenig, 2016](TAPF.md) (authors of this paper, also from 2016)

# PERR

Something with agents carrying packages. Pretty unimporant
