Connection between MAPF and network flow

When all agents are treated as a single agent with
high dimensional configuration space, multiple algorithms 
exist [7] [4] TODO! However, the curse of dimensionality
makes these algorithms bad. (called coupled approaches)

Therefore, we want local search, such as decoupling.

"discrete grid abstraction model"

approach:
3 step process
* Target assignment
* Path allocation
* Trajectory scheduling

TODO: what do these steps mean?

Note: good content summary on page 3

Network flow: standard definition
Dynamic network flow: each edge that flow goes through takes time   
  - either discrete or continuous time.

Equivalence between flow and MAPF is established (through some complex proof...)
