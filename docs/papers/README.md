# Paper summaries and notes


## Pretty important
* [Multi-Agent Pathfinding: Definitions, Variants, and Benchmarks](MAPF-definition.md) (definition of mapfm is given. Links to our own mapfm definition derived from this.)
* [Optimal Target Assignment and Path Findingfor Teams of Agents](TAPF.md) (basically MAPFM but specifically CBS)
* [Meta agents](meta-agents.md)
* [M*](mstar.md)

## Not that important
* [Mapf connected to network flow](MAPF-netflow.md) (equivalence is shown and generally a nice paper)
* [Generalizations](Generalizations.md) (mostly about the fact that [TAPF](TAPF.md) exists)

# Useless

* [Delay probabilities](delay_probabilities.md)
